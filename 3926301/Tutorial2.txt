TUTORIAL 2 - CAMERA FOLLOW

To create a script that allows the camera to follow the player, we first need to add a c# script to the main camera by selecting Add component > New script > and naming the script.

We can store the players scale, position and rotation using the transform variable, this is useful as we can now move the camera while using the player as a reference.
this is done by:

public Transform player;

// To make sure we are referencing our specific player we need to drag our player from under the hirarchy tab in Unity into our player variable into our c# script component in the main camera.

To follow our player we will need to write down:

	public Transform player;

	void Update()
    {
        transform.position = player.position;
    }

// The function "transform.position" references the current location of the camera where the term "position" specifies what aspect of "transform" we are focusing on.
// Making the cameras position = to the players position means the camera now follows the player.

However we now can no longer see the player as we are positioned inside the cube, which means we are essentially in a first person perspective.
To fix this we need to add a vector variable to offset our camera away from our player, which can be done like this


    public Transform player;
    public Vector3 offset;

    void Update()
    {
        transform.position = player.position + offset;
    }

// In the Unity launcher we can edit the position of the camera relative to the player by changing the values under "offset", vector 3 allows us to edit 3 different values, in this case we are editing the X, Y and Z position of the camera.
// This transformation is done in relation to the player as seen in "player.position + offset" where we changed the position of the camera whilst also keeping it connected to the player.


Final script:

using UnityEngine;

public class FollowPlayer : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform player;
    public Vector3 offset;

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        transform.position = player.position + offset;
    }
}
