The tutorials are in a seperate folder but the learning journal is saved outside.
The Playthrough is with the Learning journal.
If the playthrough does not work it is hosted on Youtube here : [Playthrough](https://youtu.be/zKN-kEDn83M)

To open the Level Go to the Project Tab -> Scenes -> And load the "Level Scene".

In the game the player has to collect the keys (yellow capsules) and the red and blue objects are teleporters to get to the keys.
The game still has extra gun and target(enemy) scripts marked obsolete. This is because I change the behaviour of those objects. 

After the Aim Trainer the big red cube that lets you exit does work. It will not exit out of Unity but it sends a Debug.Log that the code does work.

If you play the game with the game screen focused the game starts with the character looking down. This is because the cursor is outside the Game Screen.
Play Maximised does not have this issue.
