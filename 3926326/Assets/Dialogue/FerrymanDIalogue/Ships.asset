  - Yeah, ships! Don't you see 'em? Perhaps you could borrow my binoculars for a
    moment, take a look for yourself!
  - '*He hands you some incompatable hardware. You try to use it, but see nothing.
    You play along anyway.'
  - I have my own ferry, yknow. She ain't the prettiest thing, but she's mine. Called
    her 'The Borealis'. Sometimes I use her to bring folks between this lil' island
    here and the mainland.
  - '*You hand back the binoculars. You still don''t know what a ship is, but apparently
    they''re a type of girl.'
