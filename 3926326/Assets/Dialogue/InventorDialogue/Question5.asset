  dialogue:
  - Ah-! That's- that's right! You got it! The field test was a success!
  - Ah, but, I still have one more question for you. Don't worry, there's no wrong
    answer here.
  - I'm just... curious, is all.
  - Doubtless you've noticed, you percieve things differently to the rest of us,
    don't you?
  - We're on a lush, green island. There's flowing waters surrounding us, green grass
    beneath our feet. Everyone here looks different in their own wonderful way.
  - But you can't see that, can you? You don't even know what I look like.
  - I suppose my question is... how does it make you feel? To view the world so differently
    when compared to the rest of us?
