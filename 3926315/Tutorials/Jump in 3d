# code on how to make 3d character jump

# 1. make a new scene 

in the hierachy right-click to add 2 3d objects: a cube and a 3d plane(name it ground)

in the project right-click to create a new folder called scripts and open it up

double-click the folder and right-click again and create a c# script and immediately name it 'Jump' (if you dont name it straight away it will automatically name the code'NewBehaviour' as well as setting the class to the name 
causing problems with the programs ability to be recognise the code)

click onto the cube look at the inspector and scroll all the way to the bottom and add component 'rigidbody' 

#2. creating the code 

open the c# script you just created 

and add these lines befre void start:
    public float JumpForce = 5.0f; 

float is a non-fixed number. jumpforce just being the strength of the vertical motion which we set to 5.0, f just refering to it being a float
    
    public bool IsOnGround = true; 

bool is a action that can either be true or false, in this case we are saying that the object -is- on the ground

    private Rigidbody PlayerRb; 

this applies a rigid body so that it cannot be deform that much or at all(PlayerRb is just the name we gave it so we can recognise it in the code)

    void Start()
       {
           PlayerRb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); 
       }

before the first frame update get the component rigidbody 
 if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.Space) && IsOnGround)  
        {
            PlayerRb.AddForce(Vector3.up * JumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
            IsOnGround = false;
        }
this code is saying if the input of the boect is up and is on ground the add force to the rigidbody (on the xyz axis) up, and instantly applied a force based on the timestep
finally make is on ground false 
 private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Ground"))
        {

        }
        IsOnGround = true;
    }
when 2 objects like the 3d plane and cube make contact enter collison. if it collides with the gameobject called ground make is on ground true
