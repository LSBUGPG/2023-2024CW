# 1.Camera Follows Character Object 

create a new c# script and name it 'CameraFollow'

attach it to the main camera in the heiarchy 

then double click to open the c# you created

#2. creating the code 

public Transform target;
public Vector3 offset;

    void Update()
    {
        transform.position = target.position + offset;
    }
}

firstly we add a public transform so we can change the positon of the camera within the unity engine. we also add a xyz offset so we can position the camera as we'd like to look on the character

the after void start we write that after the frame updates transform is the position of the target(in this case the camera) + the offset
