# Movement in 3d tutorial 

how to make a 3d character move on the x and z axis in a 3d plane

# 1. create a new scene

in the hierachy right-click add 3 3d objects: a 3d plane,a cube and a capsule 

in the project right-click to create a new folder called scripts and open it up

double-click the folder and right-click again and create a c# script and immediately name it 'PlayerMovement' (if you dont name it straight away it will automatically name the code'NewBehaviour' as well as setting the class to the name causing problems with the 
programa ability to be recognise the code)

# 2. creating the code

double-clich the 'PLayerMovement' script and it will automatically open the script in visual studios(VS)

first you need to create 3 floats one for speed of movement,one for horizontal movements and one for forward and backwards movements

    public float speed = 5.0f; <--- this one is made public so that we can manually change it from unity instead of having to go backwards and forwards from VS and unity
    private float HorizontalInput;
    private float ForwardInput;

(note a float is used by the engine to store floating point number values, these being mom-fixed numbers that chaged based on the rest of the code)

under void update firstly we need to define what the float do by telling them that when inputting a direction on the keyboard 

    HorizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
    ForwardInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

(make sure to go back into unity and under edit->project settings-> input manager check out that the imputs are according to what keys you what to used aka wsda or arrow keys)

    transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime * speed * ForwardInput);
    transform.Translate(Vector3.right * Time.deltaTime * speed * HorizontalInput);

most of this code is self explanatory
transform = change physical attributes
translate = to move 
vector3 = on the xyz axes
Time.deltaTime = according to the changing of frames
speed = speed

so all this code is saying is to change the movement on the xyz axes accordinf the frames,speed and keyboard imput

thats it for the input however always rememeber to save(ctrl+s) before testing as the changes won't be applied to unity till you do
