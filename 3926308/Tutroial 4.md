**Adding all required objects**

First, create your object that'll kill your player and name this Death, or, whatever you want to call this. Next, create an empty and place it where you want to respawn. 

**Code**

Create a new script and name it Respawn. This code will be responsible for Death and respawning. 


First, Delete everything that comes after Monobehaviour. All of this is not needed. This is all the code you need. Create your privates, we do not want to edit this as they are not required to change.

The final part, tells the code that on trigger, move the player to the respawn transforms. 


**Assembly**


Drag the code into your kill zones or block

Finally, drag in your player and respawn point. 


That's your basic player respawn!
