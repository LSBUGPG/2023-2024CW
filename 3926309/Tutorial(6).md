# Dino Game Tutorial

I used this code from: https://github.com/zigurous/unity-dino-game-tutorial /

 ## 6. Prefabs

Create a Prefab Folder. In Heirarchy drag the the obstacles sprites add a  "Obstacle Tag".

The reason why we use tag is so the system knows what we refer to when added in code later.

Add a Box Collider and change the order layer to one to all of them. If you have an flying obstacle add the Animated Spite script to it. 
Click the plus sign and add how many movements you have of that obstacle.

A Box Collider allows us the player or object to collider with each other instead of going through each other.

if you made the space in you sprite too big you can adjust it using the Box Collider.

You can adjust the size of the box collider if it too big or too small.
